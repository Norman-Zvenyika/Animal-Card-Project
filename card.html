				Elephant, (family Elephantidae), largest living land animal, characterized by its long trunk (elongated
				upper lip and nose), columnar legs, and huge head with temporal glands and wide, flat ears. Elephants
				are grayish to brown in colour, and their body hair is sparse and coarse. They are found most often in
				savannas, grasslands, and forests but occupy a wide range of habitats, including deserts, swamps, and
				highlands in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia.
